### Overview and Assumptions
I am using IntelliJ and maven.

I set language level to Java 9 so you need to run it in Java 9 at least. 

I am only using Java 9 for some helpful methods that will make my life 
easier but that are easily interchangable with methods from Java 8.

I am making an assumption that the maze files provided are valid if they 
meet certain requirements. As long as they have one start point, one exit 
point, at least one wall and one empty space I will assume that they are 
valid mazes. I recognise that there are a few edge cases (and not even 
edge cases) that are not covered by this, but for the purposes of this 
exersice this is my assumption.

I am making an assumption that the entry and exit point don't count 
towards the empty spaces (even though practically they probably are).
